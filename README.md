# Stable-Gimpfusion-3

This is a plugin for using GIMP 3 with Stable Diffusion.

[Original plugin by ArtBIT](https://github.com/ArtBIT/stable-gimpfusion) was written on python2 for GIMP 2.10.

Rewriten version runs on python3 for GIMP 3. Some refactoring and UI/UX optimisation was made.

Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with PPA GIMP (no sandboxed environments like AppImage, snap of flatpak) and
[Stable Diffusion Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge).
